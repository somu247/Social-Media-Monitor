# Social-Media-Monitor
Automatically monitor and log fans/followers/likes counters from social media (Facebook Pages, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, OneSignal, Alexa) using APIs to Google Spreadsheet. Very useful for website admins and social media managers.

This Google Apps Script reads numbers from social media and pages via APIs or URL parsing EVERY DAY - so you don't need to! Also you can analyze them at long-term and create cute charts.

I'm using this for some time and wanted to share it since I couldn't find this much automated and exact solution. These are all I can do with my current level of expertise (read as:"beginner").
If you know shorter ways, or want to add any social media/application, pull requests are very welcome!
